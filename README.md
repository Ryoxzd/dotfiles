## Inspiration

- [MinimalBocchi](https://github.com/Spelljinxer/dotfiles) — some layout ideas were adapted.

---

## Notes

- No rice generators or scripts were used.
- Aimed for a smooth experience on mid-spec laptops.
- Future updates will include waybar modules, keybind refinements, and better theme consistency.
